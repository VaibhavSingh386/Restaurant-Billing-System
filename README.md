# Restaurant-Billing-System
A restaurant billing system automates the process of generating bills, reducing human errors in calculations. It ensures accurate pricing, applies taxes, and includes discounts or promotions seamlessly.
Modern billing systems are often integrated with point-of-sale (POS) systems, inventory management, and customer relationship management (CRM) tools. This helps track sales, manage stock, and enhance customer service.
The system speeds up the billing process, reducing wait times for customers. It also supports multiple payment options (cash, card, digital wallets) and can generate detailed receipts, improving overall customer satisfaction.
